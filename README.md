Business card project. Next.js, chakra, three.js. The coder bear, in the header of the site, was molded and baked using MagicaVoxel, Blender. It has a given vector and rotation speed, but you can interact with it by clicking on it (Right mouse button - rotate in space, left - along the axis, wheel - zoom in or out, in the mobile application all this can be done with your fingers)
